      "The magic function system provides a series of functions which allow you to\n",

      "\n",
      "Line magics are prefixed with the % character and work much like OS\n",
      "command-line calls: they get as an argument the rest of the line, where\n",
      "arguments are passed without parentheses or quotes.  For example, this will\n",

      "\n",
      "        %timeit range(1000)\n",
      "\n",
      "Cell magics are prefixed with a double %%, and they are functions that get as\n",
      "an argument not only the rest of the line, but also the lines below it in a\n",
      "separate argument.  These magics are called with two arguments: the rest of the\n",
      "call line and the body of the cell, consisting of the lines below the first.\n",
      "For example::\n",
      "\n",
      "        %%timeit x = numpy.random.randn((100, 100))\n",

      "the very start of the cell.\n",
      "\n",
      "NOTE: If you have 'automagic' enabled (via the command line option or with the\n",

      "IPython ships with automagic on, so you should only rarely need the % escape.\n",
